# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs,
# and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs,

# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random,
# is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.

# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine
# the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
