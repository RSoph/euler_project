# We're iterating though all values of p from 3 to 1000, for each of those, all values of a from 1 to p,
# and for each of those, all values of b from a to 1000. This is kind of a disaster and should be optimized.
# It's not bad for a first try though, and it runs surprisingly fast, so I'm leaving it for now.

# NB I am aware that ruby does not contain tuples, it's just a two element list that I call a
# tuple because I've been doing too much python recently.
